# C-Sharp Projects
 This repository contains C Sharp related projects as part of The Tech Academy's Software Development Course.

Update (6/12)
- Added fully functional 21 Card Game Console Application Program

Projects:

The following projects are assignments used to teach the basic principles and fundamentals of C Sharp.

Abstract Classes:
This is a Console App project which goes over the basics of Creating Abstract Classes in C#. This application utilizes Polymorphism to create objects, as well as inheritence to use between different class files and interfaces.

Boolean Logic:
This is a Console App project which goes over the basics of Boolean logic and how to utilize it when working with comparison operators. 

Branching Submission:
This is a Console App project including a program for a package shipping company. The user inputs the dimensions of a package to ship and the program determines whether or not the package meets the necessary requirements for shipping based on certain parameters. For example, if the package weight exceeds 50lbs, the console will write a message stating the package is too heavy to be shipped. If all requirements are met and parameters are passed, the total amount for shipping will be calculated as the end result.

Car Insurance
This is an MVC Web application which acts as a car insurance website. A user input is taken and a quote is calculated based on business logic. An Admin controller is also included which allows any administrators to view all quotes that have been submitted.

Challenge Submissions:
This is an MVC Web application which includes custom headers and a Date Time function returning the current day and time.

ConsoleApp Submission:
This is a Console App project which utilizes do-while loops to determine whether the user can guess the program's favorite numbers.

Constructor:
This is a ConsoleApp project which utilizes constructor variables and chains them together withiin a class.

Daily Report:
This is a Console App project which goes over the basic data types in C# and how to utilize and convert them to our project needs.

DateTime:
This is a Console App project which asks for a user to enter a number, which is then converted into DateTime to calculate the current time plus the user's input number in hours.

Final Challenge 3:
This is a Console App project which creates a Student Database using Entity Framework and assigns values of Student's name and grade to a new table.

Lambda:
This is a Console App project which goes over basic Lambda functions and how to utilize them. In this example, Lamda functins are used to create a list of employees with identical first name's of "Joe."

Main Methods:
This is a Console App project going over Methods and how to utilize them through calling and passing in objects. In this example we're calling the separate "operations" class. The program takes user inputs which are converted to different data types, then returns results of those objects after performing math operations to the input number.


Math Comparisons:
This is a Console App project which goes over how Math Comparison Operations and how to utilize them. In this example, we're comparing Anoymous Income's between two people. A user inputs their hours, wages and income, which is then compared with another user to determine whether one user makes more income than the other.

Method Class Submissions:
This is a Console App project which creates two integer inputs, then performs math operations on those numbers to return the sum.

Methods and Objects:
This is a Console App project which includes a person, employee and program class. The person class includes two strings of first and last name, as well as a void "SayName" function which writes the full name of the person to the console. The Employee class inherits from the Person class to create a new list of strings by Id. The employee object is instantiated and initialized with a first and last name, then finally returns a called super class method of "SayName" which writes the full name to the console.

NewsletterAppMVC
This is an MVC web application which utilizes web forms and Entity Framework to sign up users to a newsletter. After clicking the submit button, the data is transferred to a newly created Newsletter Database, which then returns the user to a SignUp page message of "Success." A user can choose to navigate to the "admin" controller to view those user inputs, and may also unsubscribe to the newsletter through that controller.

Operators:
This is a Console App project similar to the previous "Math Comparison" project. In this program, we create a list of Employees through instatiating objects of the "employee" class. We demonstrate the use of "Overloaded" methods with Operators by overriding them within our employee class. Values are assigned to those object properties which are then compared using the newly overloaded operators. These employee values are added to an Employees list, then returned as results of "Employee Information" to the Console. 

Parsing Enums:
This is a Console App project which goes over the "Enum" data type and how to utilize it through parsing methods. In the Enum class "Days," values are assigned to a variable of that enum data type. A user inputs the current day of the week, then returns an if statement which includes that user's input. If an invalid input was submitted, the console will return an Overflow Exception and instruct the user to enter the appropriate input.

Six Part Assignment:
This is a six-part Console App project. 

In Part One, we're utilizing a string array and user input. The user input is added to the string array "mesages" and then returns the newly formed message including the input. 

In Part Two, we're utilizing a "do-while" loop to loop through an infinite loop. A user is asked to input an integer which is then converted to Boolean logic. In the "do" loop, the Console writes a statement based off the newly converted boolean logic. The "while" loop is then executed returning a new message to the Console.

In Part Three, we're creating a loop where the "<" comparison operator is used to determine whether or not to continue iterating through the list "Final scores." Utilizing "for" loops, if a score is greater than 85, the console writes a line of the final test scores. In another for loop where "<=" is the comparison operator, if a score is equal to or less than 84, the if statement is printed out which includes failing scores returned from the comparison operator.

In Parts Four and Five, we're creating a list and asking the user to select an input from that list. A for loop iterates through that list and if the user input is equal to a value in that list, the console returns the matching value. If the user input is not found within the list, the following if statement will write to the Console informing the user that there's no match in the list. 

In Part Six, we're creating two lists of strings with grade values. Using a "for each" loop, if an identical grade in the list "grades" is detected, the console will write an if statement stating that identical grade has occured before. Otherwise, it will print the else statement and continue looping through those lists. After looping, the non-identical values are added to a new list.

Strings and Integers:
In this Console App project, our program utilizes try and catch blocks to loop through different types of exceptions. A user is asked to select a number from an integer list. Using a for loop, the code within will divide each list item by the user input number, which will then write those results to the console. If the user input is invalid, a catch loop will recognize the exception and return a message depending on the exception type.

Twenty One (21) Card Gmae:
This is a Console Application including the traditional card game of 21. Input your name and number amount you'll bring to the table, then place your bet to begin playing.
- Features: Hit/Stay user inputs, Custom error message if the input value is greater than the amount you have, etc.
